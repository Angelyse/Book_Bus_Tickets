Bus Schedule Management: Admins can add, update, and delete bus schedules, including route, departure time, and ticket price. Ticket Booking: Users can select a bus route, specify the number of tickets, and confirm the booking. thanks

Architecture Overview The system is built using PHP and MySQL for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and integrates USSD functionality for user interaction. Below is an overview of the main components: Database: MySQL is used to store user data, bus schedules and bus bookings.

USSD Workflow User Registration: User sends an SMS containing their name and password in Africa’s talking. The system checks if the user is already registered. If not, it registers the user and sends a confirmation SMS. Account Management: Users interact with the USSD menu to view account details, update password, or view booked tickets. The system processes user selections and provides relevant options. Bus Route Selection: Users select a bus route from the available options. They specify the number of tickets and confirm the booking and make payment of booked tickets.
